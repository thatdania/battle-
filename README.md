# Battle2 ðŸ•¹ðŸ•¹

This project was about building a battling game in pairs throughout the week using Ruby.
We learnt how to connect different elements such as players, scores and attacks in diferrent
routes of the controller. Given we did this in pairs, this was a work in progress project as
we jumped between people's projects across the week depending on thier progress. 

Note: This was a work in progress project. See this repo: https://github.com/thatdania/Battlegame for the furthest progress. 

# Domain Model (User stories that we wanted to cover) 

A strategy to approaching the problems of the challenge was to list out all the user stories that represented requirements for
the website in order for it to accomplish the challenge. My pair partner and I came up with this model before touching any code
in order to know what requirements neede to be met.  

| Objects       | Messages      | Output                      |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------------------------:|
| fight(names)  | enter and see | Start fight by seeing names |
| P2 Hit points | want to see   | See player 2's hit points   |
| confirmation  | attack P2     | P1 wins a game of battle    |
| Attack(HP)    | reduce        | P2 hp is reduced by 10      |
| turns         | switch        | Switch from P2 to P1 turn   |
| hit points    | see           | P1 sees their hit points    |
